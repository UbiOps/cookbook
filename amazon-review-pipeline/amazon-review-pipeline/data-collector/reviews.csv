2020-12-21 11:15:51,1608549351,B00904JILO,NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter with Miracast (PTV3000) Certified for use with Kindle Fire HDX,Could not get it to display tablet screen.,"Used two different Lenovo Tablet 2 devices with Windows 8 and 8.1. It would see the device and connect to it. Connection would show on the TV screen and tablet would confirm it was connected but it would never give the option to send the display to the screen when trying to switch over to remote display.Updated all drivers, even downgraded some drivers to try older ones as we had an older Push2TV that would work with our Tablet 2's. Tried original firmware that came on the device as well as the latest firmware with no change in behavior.I returned this item after about 5 hours of total time trying to get it to work.",0.0
2020-12-21 11:52:01,1608551521,B00CDS9HTM,AmazonBasics Large DSLR Gadget Bag (Gray interior),"Useful and roomy, just trim the pointies","Top flap has velcro strips so you can flip it down and have it reasonably secure without using the main straps. However, you'll still have to zip it for the flap to stay in place (else it just takes the unzipped lid with it). Side pockets expand about an inch. Front pocket has some organization for pens, memory cards, etc.and a zippered mesh compartment. Main lid also has a zippered mesh.Main compartment has a slot for a small tablet such as iPad Mini, Google Nexus 7, Amazon Kindle Fire. Enough storage for a DSLR and three lenses. Interior 10.25&#34; x 4.5&#34; with some give, and configurable, padded dividers. However, the velcro strips have sharp, pointy corners, so be careful - you may want to trim these.Shoulder strap has plastic hardware (clasps, etc.), so it may feel a bit cheap (it certainly sounds cheap). But they seem sturdy enough to handle whatever you'd normally put in this bag, unless it's a bowling ball.Two wide, rubber feet to stabilize it.All in all a good buy for $25.",1.0

It looks great, feels great and protects great.  But for the Record - It is not real leather.  The Description Reads: PU Leather.  PU means &#34;poly urethane&#34; - in other words, synthetic man made leather.  As far as I'm concerned, this is not a negative and the interior is soft and plush.  I originally bought this for a Surface Pro 2 but I find myself using it more with my companion - Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2, which is a 10.1&#34; Win 8 tablet.  I love this little case, it carries nicely in the hand on it's own or fits into a laptop bag easily without adding bulk.  I highly recommend it.",1.0

The outside is made of durable, water repellent nylon.  Not water proof - don't sit it in a puddle or leave it in the rain.  I use the adjustable shoulder strap but my husband prefers the handle on top.  The best part is the pockets!  There are 6 of them to hold everything from electronics to baby bottles.  We seriously use this bag to carry so many different items.  Pretty sure they intended this to be a camera bag but it has many uses.The bag was FREE to me because I'm a VINE member but I would have no problem spending the $24.99 list price.",1.0
2020-12-21 12:53:34,1608555214,B00728ZB8O,Panasonic Lumix TS4 12.1 TOUGH Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Optical Zoom (Silver),Works Well As Expected,"I bought this camera to record our trip to Key West where my wife competed in the Swim Around Key West - a 12.5 mile open ocean swim race - as well as the trip in general. The conditions this year were terrible with high winds and a good deal of waves plus the water being all dirty and stirred up, blowing sand and so forth. I used the camera extensively in these conditions and even 'tested it' by accidentally dropping it several times onto sand or hard packed earth. At one point, I waded out to snap the swimmers, but got knocked off my feet by a big wave and dropped the camera into the surf. It got banged around a bit until I picked it back up. I figure it got waved tumbled 3 or 4 times onto the loose coral type sand Key West sports. The camera took it all in stride.Given this is a P&S; JPEG only camera, I didn't expect the quality of the output to equal, say, my Canon 5D2 or my friend's Hassie H3 - let's get real here, but for what it is, it worked very well. The pictures are generally high quality with acceptable noise and except for the usual cropping need due to the LCD area not being what the lens captures, don't really need any post processing. Color balance was better than average for this class of camera too with a bit of a bias toward the warm side.The downsides are for me, the flash. This has one eager flash ready to go off when I don't think it's needed and when it does, all too often it creates hot spots ruining the photo. I found the camera's performance all right in normal indoor lighting without the flash so I turned it off entirely and never missed it. I wish there was a setting to lower the flash's output to use as fill lighting but then again, we're getting into DSLR territory for that feature. Another downside, which is universal in this category, is lack of RAW output. Yeah, I know - few wish this but it'd mean we could get so much more out of the camera through post processing. I just cannot give a five star rating to a JPEG only camera.On the up side, the menu system is the best I've ever seen - well laid out and easy to understand even for my wife who is a militant against complex cameras. She used the camera happily (the first one she has ever been happy with) and got some really terrific HD movies and stills in the Butterfly Museum at macro distances.Overall, I'm happy but sure would like a RAW option.",1.0

NO.Is it still worth every penny I paid?  YES.For me, setting it up could not have been easier.  It worked on the first try with the like 5-step directions that were included in the box.With that said, I had a few headaches initially with scaling issues but realized (after about 20 minutes) that this was the TV's fault, not the PTV3000.  I changed the scaling to &#34;1:1&#34; and now it works perfect.I am using a Dell Venue 8 Pro with this to power a 1080p Sceptre LCD display.  It works incredibly well.  Is there noticeable lag?  Of course there is.  I'm using an 8&#34; tablet with a full versions of Windows on it.  But, the lag is completely tolerable for everything I do with the machine.

It works great.  The CORD is about 77"", but from tip to tip it is about 80"".  I measured it.  They did not skimp on the cord length.  I really like the green ""power"" light that turns on when it is plugged in.  I haven't timed it, but it take no longer to recharge my tablet compared to the original Samsung charger.

2020-12-21 13:56:02,1608558962,B00728ZB8O,Panasonic Lumix TS4 12.1 TOUGH Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Optical Zoom (Silver),Returned Because of Poor Quality of Still Images,"After many hours of research, the TS4 narrowly edged out the Olympus and Nikon competitors in the underwater, ruggedized class. I bought one in February. And I returned it at the beginning of March.The camera performs very poorly in anything other than full sunlight. Giant -- and I mean GIANT -- artifacts or large smeared areas appear in shots taken in any other conditions. One shot taken two full hours before sunset has what appears to be a pixelated version of the Batplane hovering over the northern horizon. Another shot of a stand of trees taken at the same time has a large area that looks like a watercolor painted by a blind person.The camera also has an uncanny ability to pick up glare that is invisible to the human eye. I had read of this issue in a couple of reviews but assumed that some form of operator error must have been involved. No so. This camera has magical powers, and not the good kind. If you are shooting something that is in a stream or pond or behind glass, there's a good chance you're going to get a surprise.Even in decent light, the camera struggled to find focus. Roughly one in five of my portrait shots were badly out of focus.To my eye, the camera's images were also flat and lacked saturation.The quality of the video was adequate.After resuming my research, I am beginning to suspect that none of the waterproof point-and-shoots currently on the market will produce still images that equal those of non-waterproof point-and-shoots that sold for $100 five years ago. My old Olympus FE-340 certainly took better stills than the TS4.",0.0

2020-12-21 18:06:18,1608573978,B00728ZB8O,Panasonic Lumix TS4 12.1 TOUGH Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Optical Zoom (Silver),A great take-anywhere little camera,"The recently released Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS4 is a fantastic choice if you want a carry-anywhere camera that you even take underwater. It's fine as a regular point-and-shoot, but it really shines for fun in the water. Read on for more info.For most situations, I use a big Nikon SLR, preferably with a fast prime (fixed focal length) lens. That's the best solution for the family gatherings, recitals, all the usual stuff. I am an amateur, though. I like good gear, but I still am learning how to use it properly. So sometimes I get blurry shots. Overexposed. Less-than-ideal composition. But I try very hard to get it right, often with some pretty good results. That's with the big Nikon.But the best camera is the one you have with you, on your person. And that's not always going to be a big fat SLR. Commuting to work, running to the grocery store, walking the dog. You really going to carry that monster? No. So the little Lumix is a fantastic choice. It fits in your pocket, is waterproof to any depth most of us will take it (40 feet), and you can drop it once or twice before it breaks.It also has the usual geegaws of recent cameras. GPS, good video, the usual. This little guy even has an altimeter and a barometer. (Altimeter I get. Barometer, not at all.) Of all these many features, apart from waterproofing, the standouts are the optical zoom and the automatic panorama. An optical zoom, as you probably know, is vastly better than what is sometimes called a ""digital zoom."" Digital zoom is not a zoom at all, it's just making a part of the image bigger. A true optical zoom uses sophisticated glass to extend the focal length of the camera, without losing any resolution. It's pretty amazing that this little Lumix has a 4.6x optical zoom within its waterproof housing. Phenomenal, really.The instant panorama is a more common feature on cameras these days. The Lumix's just works really well.Downsides? The camera requires Panasonic's crumby and confusing proprietary software to get videos off a card. The software takes a long time to install, and doesn't appear available on their website. So save that disc! And woe betide you if you have a fancy laptop without a disc drive.But the inconvenience of this sub-par software is far outshined by the pretty remarkable performance of this take-anywhere little gem.

I buy cameras all the time. I buy them for myself my family and recommend them for my friends. I love to do the research and usually enjoy the results. This camera came highly recommended by reliable sources(DPreview etc) and I purchased it 15 months ago. I bought this camera to serve a specific role as the go anywhere, not worry about camera that I could give to my six-year-old. It was for vacation swimming and snorkeling as well as winter skiing when it was extremely cold and other cameras wouldn't work. It served those purposes well during its first year. It gave decent pictures. It's GPS function was reliable. It was problem free and gave good underwater pictures as well. I followed the recommendations about maintenance for the camera's battery and memory card door (yes I read directions). I have a Nikonos film underwater camera. Yes I am old, but I understand the care and maintenance that's required for cameras that you take underwater.Last week while vacationing in Hawaii, snorkeling in shallow water we encountered a pod of dolphins. They were playfully all around us. A fantastic photo op. It was at that moment that my Lumix failed. The screen became multicolored lines without a discernible image and I could not capture an image. The day was partially saved by my wife's Canon S 95. She was able to capture some of the action from topsides.I researched this online and found that many owners had this problem and that Panasonic had recommended that after year you buy an expensive kit from them to recondition the door seal or send the camera to them and for a very significant fee they would do that repair/Maintenance.This is not mentioned in their owners manual nor did I receive an email or written product advisory. Now I have an expensive bronze colored paperweight. Based on the reviews Panasonic has not done anything for all of those customers whose cameras failed in this fashion.So sorry Panasonic but I will not be buying any more of your products. This is not how you treat customers. You are not Apple we have lots of other choices for the products that you make.",0.0

Such a bag needs to hold everything securely, provide good padding on all sides, have compartments and pockets for accessories and cables and should be well-made. This bag meets all of those criteria, and a little more, for a reasonable price.The main compartment of this bag is very roomy, able to hold a large camera and lenses with room to spare. However, it's not enough to just have room - there needs to be some way to secure the items so they do not shift or knock around. To accommodate this, there are four cloth-covered foam dividers that can be moved and reattached in any desired configuration, making this a bag that always has the right sized compartment.One of the things I noticed about this bag is that it has an astoundingly good amount of padding, on every side. The padding is sufficient to protect the contents during drops and falls (to a reasonable degree, of course) and will even protect in a crammed compartment when traveling. To a point, there's sufficient protection to thwart crushing the bag, too. This bag provides better protection for my camera than most bags provide for a laptop computer.There are four zippered pockets for cables, film (if you use a film camera), cleaning supplies and whatever else you need with you. These pockets are a little on the thin side so there is limited room, but they have sufficient padding to prevent a lot of possible damage that could happen during travel.The outer material of the bag is made of higher-grade nylon mesh, which makes the bag at least partially water resistant. I suspect that the bag floats too, but I am not willing to test this idea, particularly when it is loaded...As I write this, this bag goes for $25, which is competitive with other bags in the same general size and feature class. The fact that it's a ""store brand"" bad is inconsequential - this is a well-made bag with a good feature set, worth its asking price.",1.0

I took it up on mountains, down into the sea, on hot and dusty hikes, into silt storms - and about one thousand scratches and drops later it kept ticking. It's the ocean water that did it in in the end. You really do need to soak the camera in fresh water after you snorkel or scuba, otherwise the salt will eat away at the rubber seals. Then let it dry completely.It started faltering on my latest trip, and I bought an Olympus competitor locally - couldn't stand it and returned it.This new TS-4 is actually better than its successor, the TS-5: fewer pixels, meaning less noise at the same size sensor. You don't need the extra pixels, you need a cleaner picture in the first place and 12 megapixels are more than enough. OIS works very well, and pictures are quite crisp even underwater. As a land camera, I like the Canon D series a little better (nothing can rival the picture quality on those little jewels), but I found the TS series performed better in tough environments. It also has terrific macro, nearly as good as the Canons.What would make this a perfect camera? The ability to shoot in RAW, a slightly larger sensor and a bit more analog zoom so you don't have to get so close to the subject.",1.0

I go for lots of walks and wanted something I could slip in my pocket and take with.  Works great for this.  Does great on overall landscape, people, and overall images.  The downfall with this camera seems to be that it takes too long to do a preview of the photo that you just shot.  I haven't found a way to turn this off yet so it could just be me having the issue.

It's too tight to fit just about any of my digital kit (a Canon EOS 5D Mark III with battery grip is too big unless you remove the lens every time you put it away, and even then it takes up so much room that you can't fit a lens in there).  Luckily, that was not the purpose for which I ordered this bag.  I got it for my primary film camera, a Mamiya C330 Professional.For this purpose, it works nicely.  Due to the squarish tall shape of the TLR, it fits perfectly in the bag in both width and height. Placing one of the velcro dividers to give it a snug fit on all four sides, there's just enough room for one extra lens pair and a light meter (or if I pocket the light meter, I can maneuver an Olymput OM-4T with 50mm Zuiko in there). The front pouch can hold more 120 film than I'd be likely to use in a single day.We recently went for a weekend trip and I decided to make it a film-only trip, so I brought this bag with me.  It was during the trip that I saw some down sides.  First, the wide pad in the strap doesn't hold the strap in place very well, which eventually gets folded and bunched up inside the pad, causing discomfort when carrying it.  Then the plastic mechanism on either side of the strap that allows it to rotate freely makes loud, squeaky rubbing noises with every step, and that got annoying very quickly. For such an inexpensive bag though, I felt I could only realistically dock one star for these issues.  The bag itself, aside from the strap, does the job nicely.",1.0

The versatility and the built in features/modes allow you to capture any situation you come across. To date I have travelled through the Galapagos, Ecuador and Peru and Florida with this camera. I've never had a single problem with the toughness of this camera. I originally bought a small case to toss it in but after using it for awhile I wasn't worried about it getting messed up throwing it in a pouch of my back pack. There are some things I'd like to be better, but they might be a limitation to all these types of cameras though. I outlined them in pros and cons.Pros:Great quality pictures- I have a Fujifilm HS30EXR as well that I used travelling. It's a lot more convient to carry this around. The Fuji has better results in the end but the TS4 compares really well. In an age where 90% of photos are just going to be resized and emailed or posted on Facebook this camera is way more than good enough on quality.Great features- Lots of modes that are easily accessed. The more comfortable you get the faster you'll get at switching modes too. I left it in the iA mode most of the time but picking a specific mode can make a difference and is worth the effort.Size- It's not as small as others but it feels substantial and you can get a good grip on it, which I think is better. I've used a fuji that was more streamlined and it was a little too small. I'd be nervous to use it n water. That was not a problem here. I could fit in the front pocket of my jeans, it'd be better in a cargo pocket though.Toughness- I've gone snorkeling twice a day for a week, had sand rubbed all over it, dropped it, submerged it over the side of a boat  while going down the amazon to see how the pictures would turn out. It survived it all easily. Really is a great and tough camera.Battery life- Battery life is great. I wish I could say how many shots I got before I recharged it. I never use flash and the battery would last two days for me on average. Probably took about a 50-100 pictures a day and left the camera on to get a GPS lock and have it ready for a photo. The battery was never fully drained. I took it on a four day hike where I only had one battery the last day it almost died because I was taking a lot of video.GPS and altimeter etc- Maybe it's kind of a gimmick but I think it is really cool to see exactly where you were. In a worst case scenario the built in compass could probably help you out of a bind as well.Lanyard- The included lanyard is probably pretty standard but it was a good diameter and feel. I say this because I cinched it down to make sure it never got away from me when swimming and I never had any irritation and all the salt water never discolored it or wore it down.Dedicated video button is convenient.Cons:Foggy lens- I have a quite a few pictures that were ruined by fog in the lens. Nothing you can really do about it when it happens and I think it'd be really difficult to fix after the fact. It definitely ruined a couple picture I really wanted to turn out. I think this is a hazard of this type of camera, not really the TS4 itself.GPS lock-Perfectly clear skies and it had to of taken well over five minutes. My Garmin watch doesn't take that long on cloudy days. Sometimes it would get a fix really quick and scroll the name of the location and country right away. I think this is a con because when I pull a point and shoot out of my camera I want to take a picture and have it work right away with an accurate GPS tag.Panorama Problems-I was in these massive sand dunes in Peru and wanted to take a panorama of the view. I tried at least 10-15 times to take a panorama changing sweep directions and widths and views hoping the camera would capture one. Always got error messages along the lines of go faster or slower or keep levelt. Keep in mind I've been using this camera for awhile at this point and had taken many panoramas. I'm not sure if it was the lack of contrast from sand dune to sand dune but I never got the picture.Underwater warning-It shows up every time. I get it, I read the instructions, I acknowledged them. Now I'll still have to do it every time I turn on the camera.I have used three other brands of tough cameras, Fuji, Pentax and Casio, this one is by far the best in picture quality and features/ease of use. I think you just have to accept the cons if you want this type of camera. I debated giving this four/five stars because five stars really should mean it is perfect. I ended up giving it five stars because this really is the best tough camera you can get right now.",1.0

It worked for a brief period of time on by Dell Inspiron 15z laptop with Windows 8. But it stopped working twice due to auto updates (once to Windows 8 itself and the other time when my graphics card auto-updated). I spent hours on the phone with tech support with Dell and the tech rolled back all sorts of drivers to get it to work. Even when it did work it wasn't a terribly great experience. The video was lagged and cut out, there were pixels that flashed in and out.Here is the bottom line: this thing is likely to cause you significant grief. You might be lucky and have a perfect combination of all components, but maybe not. As I see it, the problem is that there are so many different companies that have a hand in the pot that it increases the likelihood that something will prevent this from working. Intel makes the chip, Netgear makes the device, Windows is the operating system, and likely you will have Dell/HP/Asus/etc. for the PC maker. There are so many different possible ways this can not work it is highly likely you will hit one of them. And then each company will point the finger at the other and blame the operating system/graphics card/chip maker/etc.Save yourself some time and get an HDMI cord and run it from your laptop to your TV instead. It's not nearly as cool, but it will save you time and money. Apple TV works way better, but they own all the components in between and can ensure a better experience. But alas, I'm a windows guy, so I'm out of luck. My device is going to be resold for whatever I can get for it. I strongly regret this purchase.",0.0

The thing is that it just didn't work great. It forces the sound through the wireless display, as far as I could tell there's no way to have the display on screen while routing music through the stereo's Bluetooth receiver. Then there's noticable latency between what you see on the phone screen and the TV screen, and the connection has a tendency to flake out. Sometimes it stayed stable for a few minutes, sometimes for a half-hour, but it always disconnected itself at some point. And it didn't play nice with another Bluetooth connection - when trying to use a bluetooth keyboard with trackpad the wireless display would disconnect almost immediately.After giving up trying to use it to mirror my phone, I turned to trying to use it to beam my upstairs computer screen down to the living room. Since I was in process of rebuilding my computer I had an opportunity to put the right parts in to make it WiDi compatible - an Intel Core i7-3770K and an Intel Centrino 6205 for Desktop wireless card. It was a fun project but eventually also didn't pan out. The Intel documentation on the specification and requirements for WiDi on a desktop is a bit convoluted, and deep in a support forum comment I eventually found an Intel employee telling someone that &#34;Wireless display is intended to come pre-installed on an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) computer instead of self built.&#34; (http://communities.intel.com/message/187480#187480)I did end up getting WiDi to work, through a combination of installing the compatible Intel parts, installing their latest software, and disabling my graphics card. Tricky little hurdle there is that the integrated Intel graphics need to be active in order for WiDi to work. The software locks you out from trying if not. I found that it could work with a monitor connected there and other monitors connected through my (Radeon 5850) graphics card, but the most straightforward and useful way was just going into the Device Manager and disabling the graphics card before enabling WiDi. (Additional quirk: when the monitor connected to the integrated graphics was connected via an HDMI cable it would allow me to activate WiDi while other monitors were active through the graphics card, but the software would not allow WiDi to activate if the monitor connected to integrated graphics utilized a VGA cable. The latter setup did however work if the graphics card was disabled.)After getting WiDi working the display connection was still not quite stable. And I understood that I was pushing the limits on the specification. As far as I could glean from Intel's support articles and forums the WiDi spec calls for a maximum distance of 20 feet and a line of sight between the wireless antenna and receiver. My living room TV and the upstairs computer were about 35 feet apart in separate rooms. I picked up a Hi-Gain antenna and elevated both the receiver and antenna, and it seemed to help a bit. Though the signal would still inevitably timeout. As with when I tried it with my phone sometimes it stayed stable for a few minutes, sometimes for a half-hour, but it always disconnected itself at some point. So I attempted to building it out to spec. I purchased (surprisingly expensive) antenna cable extenders, then mounted both the high-gain antenna and the Push2TV receiver in the stairwell. They ended up exactly 18 feet apart with a line of sight. And yet, the stability of the display connection did not improve. At that point I was disappointed enough to return it.My take on this device is that it utilizes some very promising technologies which aren't yet ready for prime time. It worked well enough as a neat parlor trick, but just wasn't stable enough to be truly functional. Within a couple of years I'm sure it will improve.Techincal note: the device arrived with firmware version 2.2.12, which I upgraded to 2.2.15 during the course of this experience.",0.0

The connector that plugs into the tablet is very very cheaply made and the wires are also very inexpensively produced. they are not the same ""flexible"" wires that you see in most plugs, they are brittle wires designed for use with internal components that don't have to bend.  I've been extremely careful with this product and keep it neatly coiled in it's own pocket in my bag, but this thing is junk.  will I order it again?  -- yea, unfortunately, there are not any real alternatives out there for less than $50 at bestbuy.The long cable is very handy.UPDATE:  An hour after publishing this review Power + contacted me and sent me 2 replacement products at no charge 2nd day air.  The customer service is outstanding and the cables seem to have a slight re-design which makes them much less fragile.  They work very well on my 10.1 still. Nice 6 foot long cable.

I wanted something with a long cable that was longer than the OEM that came with the tablet so I can surf the net before I go to bed at night and not risk pulling the cable on either the tablet connector or the plug.  I'm also a musician and use it for reading music so the length comes in handy on the stage. What I like about this cable is that it seems to have a nice positive click and locks in to the connector on the tablet unlike the OEM which just kind of slides on. You have to pull it straight out with a little pull to take it out.  Unlike a lot of wall warts I have purchased for other devices this one doesn't break in half when I pull it out of the wall.

Pictures taken underwater seem to be above other cameras out there. Clear well light pictures under water, not to forget how great the zoom is under water. Other underwater cameras tend to loose the capability to zoom but the Panasonic holds its own on this level.  Love their color blue they picked. Easy to grasp camera has a nice weight to it. Nice size view screen for those who are in need of reading glasses. Durability stands up to my expectations. I have a 2 year old who likes to grab my camera and run.  Which means its bound to drop at one point while he runs from me. Panasonic says its shockproof to 6.6 feet and THAT is what I needed. Its waterproof up to 40 feet. Took some nice shots of my 6 year old underwater in a pool. I was extremely impressed. I did notice like other cameras you need to hold the shoot button down for a split second to let the camera adjust to the shot. When you allow that to happen the pictures come out clear and well light. Video was impressive. Very nice stability on the video, nicer then my camcorder that I own. Will be taking more video on this device easy to drop into my pocketbook and run.Panasonic has not let me down with the clarity or color. Easy to figure out functions, just like anything else that is new... practice with it. It will all come naturally as you keep using. Besides, it seems as if they kept most of their original funtions, which I like.Cons - Well there is not many. The On/Off button is level with the camera it is not raised.

Eventually something breaks, I drive over or drop one, get moisture inside, or some other nonsense.  I take tons of pictures, while camping, hiking, ATVing, snowmobiling, boating, white water rafting, kayaking, and more.  My last camera, Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8, got sand inside the lense the first time I stepped onto a beach with it, and that's when I decided to get something ruggedized.  The best I found was this TS4.  My only hesitation was the short optical zoom.  My last camera had a 16x optical zoom, and I loved it until I discovered that the long zoom also created the problem of pulling dirt inside the camera when the lens was extended and retracted.  This camera has a &#34;folding lense&#34; which means it's contained inside the camera body, and there is nothing to extend or retract.  I wasn't filled with confidence, between the folding lens and the short zoom, but I've since found that it's just fine.  Yes, it's nice to have a 16x optical zoom, but I like the ruggedness and reliability of this TS4.  It's supposed to be waterproof, but I'm not going to mess with that.  I'm just happy that I can take it to the beach, the Dunes, in the rain, inside my back pocket when I'm working in the garden, and I know that it can handle any conditions I subject it to.  I also always buy a separate set of high mAh batteries when I buy a camera.  The camera comes with a lower mAh battery that doesn't last long, compared to the high mAh.  An extra two high mAh batteries means I can go on a several day camping trip without running out of power.",1.0

Well I did for 50 days in Hawaii- or more I would have had the camera been useful for more than the first 20.  We always followed the directions, soak, rinse, brush, you name it.  The camera started flickering, and on inspection I saw a bunch of stuff had corroded inside.  I'm not super handy, but handy enough (and CHEAP) that i figured something could be shorting so I took a TINY wire brush and piece of abrasive cloth and polished all the corrosion I could see, it was a success!  After working a 70 hour week I went snorkeling with my wife, and got to take 3 (high quality pictures).

I finally get to a tech that I could barely understand who tells me that there is known issues with this unit and computers that came with Windows 8 from the factory.He directed me to a site to download older versions of drivers & the WiDi program (completely the opposite of the instructions). Their server was horribly slow so it took 15 minutes for a 137 meg program on my 20 meg download internet, the rep kept trying to get off the phone with me which I refused to do, I had almost an hour in this call so far. The older WiDi program did not work, so he had me download one version newer that was still not the current one, I got it from Dell's site so it would download faster.

Trying to understand the content of the manual for any tech product is comparable to having a root canal for me.  To avoid as much frustration as possible, I referred only to the Quick Start Guide. I started out by charging the battery.  In the Guide it distinctly says to charge it until the blinking light goes off, which will take approximately 3 hours and 50 minutes.  Sure enough, the blinking light turned off after approximately that time.  So I assumed that the battery was fully charged, and proceeded to take a couple of pictures.  At least I knew that I could not take more than that without first buying a memory card, but I wanted to try it out anyhow. Then I tried to delete the pictures, but was unable to do so no matter how many times I followed the exact instructions in the Guide. Out of frustration, I called Nikon tech support and explained the problem.  The tech lady said that she would send me a link to download the manual, even though I repeatedly told her I was following what it said in the Guide.  Very helpful advise, yes?  No!  I then tried to download the View NX2 Installer program which consists of three modules.  As soon as I stated the installation, I got a message indicating that I had to use a newer version of the program by going to the Nikon site.  I did that, but I still don't have any idea if all three modules were downloaded properly.  I still hadn't solved the problem of deleting the pictures I took, so I Googled the problem (yes folks, I do use the internet out of necessity) and read someplace in the mass of information that the battery needs to be charged overnight.  I did that, and was then able to delete the pictures.  I will now use the camera but only in fully Auto mode, because I would never be able to figure out all of the other modes, menus, and sub-menus.  I will also not call the Nikon tech people because I would probably be sent another link to download the manual.  Most of you will simply shake your head after reading this review, but I have a feeling that there are a number of others out there who get just as frustrated as I do when dealing with something that is advertised as being simple and easy to use.",0.0

But protect the screen.","I bought this for my trip to the Everglades. I am a wetland biologist and wanted a backup for my larger and more expensive camera. Plus, I was intrigued by the time lapse and underwater capability of this camera. I carried this camera in my kayak, while wading in a wide variety of ecosystems, and used it underwater. For a point and shoot this camera is well worth the money! If you take the time to really explore its features it produces amazing results. At the same time, when it is on auto it works great as well. For example, I held the camera out the car window to grab shoots of the Art Deco buildings of Miami and it worked great (good focus and color).The only thing I did to protect it was keep it in a padded case to protect the lens and screen from scrapes and scratches. And that was a good thing. In contrast, a friend of mine took hers on a cruise and kept in her pocket with miscellaneous items and the camera screen is badly scratched. So that seems to be its one weakness. I never expected to find a point and shoot I liked - until I used this one. Lastly, if you plan to use it in water or moisture, the lens will fog if you keep the camera in a setting where the temperature is dramatically different from the one you plan to use it in. For example, don't leave it in the hot car if you plan to use it in cool water because it will fog - store it at the temperature you plan to use it at. Oh, the fog will clear but it makes taking photographs at that time impossible.",1.0

This review will be on my old S6300 since its the same camera. I had my old S6300 for almost a year. In that time I took it on almost all family vacations and events. It delivered great results as long as you don't ask too much of it. Which allot of people fail to realize that it is a point and shoot camera not a DSLR....As for photo quality I'd say this camera takes better then average photo's. Noise isn't noticeable at ISO's lower then 1000 which is very good for a point and shoot.Noise at ISO 1600 isn't to bad either, its there but not in any way a distraction. You have ample room the crop photo's and the image sensor seems to have a dynamic range that is about on par with my Nikon D5100. But image quality isn't anywhere near as good. The reason being the image sensor on my D5100 is about three times the size.The S6300 gives good battery life of about 250 shots if you leave the camera in 16mp mode, if you set the camera at 16*mp (best quality) you will average about 200+ shots. Mind you this is not using the flash or reviewing pictures allot. Video mode does eat up battery life. You'll get about 30minutes of battery life in video mode. You'll also fill up an 8gb SDHC card quick if you shoot allot of 1080p videos. Video quality is very good in decent to good light. But in darker conditions it will produce grainy videos which again is to be expected from a point and shoot camera. The stereo microphones produce very clear sound and seem to have good range. However in quiet situations you do hear a bit of background hiss. This camera does have full optical zoom while recording video and the zoom speed is actually decent. Allot of cameras like this resort to digital zoom or they just slow down the zoom speed to try and quiet the sound of the lenses motor. Personally I'd pick a fast zoom speed to ensure I get the subject on video.As for the built in flash it does a great job of lighting dark rooms or areas. It doesn't overexpose or wash out colors too bad. Nikon seems to have this aspect of the S6300 almost dead on.The S6300's focus system is good but not perfect. In lower light it will struggle to find focus unless there is contrast or a clear color difference with the background and subject. Again its a point and shoot.The camera has a good amount of manual features but not too many. It also has a good bit of in camera effects and tools to fix up or change the way your pics look before you upload them to you computer.As for speed its about average. It powers on and is ready to shoot in about 3 seconds. From standby it takes about 4 seconds.Over all I liked the S6300 so much that I bought another one. Its the perfect size weight and has a great 10x zoom lens so you get almost everything you want. I could have gotten the new S6500 but I really don't think its worth it to spend $250+ on a small camera like this. So for the price the S6300 is selling for now I'd snatch one up before they run out of stock. Or you could just wait for the S6500 to drop in price.",1.0

2020-12-22 23:32:34,1608679954,B00CDS9HTM,AmazonBasics Large DSLR Gadget Bag (Gray interior),"Very well made, strong, lots of features","OK, I love camera bags. I have lots of them. My ""go to"" bag keeps winding up as theCanon 2400 SLR Gadget Bag for EOS SLR Cameras- this bag is about 15% smaller than that. The bag will hold a DSLR, small-medium speedlight and non-telephoto lens. For example, the canon 70-200 is too tall, and the Canon 8-15mm fisheye is too wide (unless you forgo the speedlight.) If I'm shooting for the day and just need the camera with lens, small speedlight and some accessories (lens cleaning kit, batteries, etc.) this is a good choice.There are a couple of features that really stand out.1) The shoulder strap connectors are sewn to a strap that wraps fully around the bag. The buckles are not simply attached to a stubby piece of material and sewn. This means the weight is supported by the strap, not the bag!2) Open the top flap and there's a secondary padded cover. Wow. That means your gear is wrapped in a cocoon of padding.3) The inside is totally covered in micro-fleece. This means that you can attach dividers anywhere - not just where the manufacturer decided to sew velcro tabs.The two end pockets have zero padding, so would only be good for batteries and the like. If you keep your memory cards in a protective case, they'd be fine here as well.  The longer flap has some padding - about 1/4 inch. Enough for casual bumps, but no good for a drop from waist height. The top flap covers this side pocket by about 30%.The carry handle does not have wrap-around straps - but all connection points are double sewn and reinforced. Same for the straps that hold the tripod.  The tripod straps will hold a compact tripod (small) or a monopod.  I almost never use these, as it's pretty clumsy and putting the bag down is awkward. The bag sits at an angle, partially on the tripod.  I find myself shoving the tripod or monopod between the handle and bag top.The bottom also has two rubber pads to prevent wear.  Overall construction is heavy duty nylon, so this should last for years, as well as have resistance to wear and abrasion.If you're looking for a smaller bag for camera, flash, small lens and tablet, this is an ideal choice. If you don't plan on carrying a small tablet (7"" or less) in the bag, I'd look at the Canon bag. Same size, but about 15% more internal space because there's no tablet pocket.",1.0

I thought the setup with my Windows Surface Pro tablet would be as smooth, but it was far from it.To start, even after updating the drivers on the PTV3000, I noticed there was no option in Windows 8 to project to a wireless display. So then began my extremely long journey of updating the Surface Pro to Windows 8.1... I think it took me almost 1 hour to just get the latest updates installed on Windows 8, and then maybe another 0.5-1 hour to get the tablet updated to Windows 8.1. Without those previous system updates, there was no option to upgrade to Windows 8.1.Ok, enough complaining about the painful process of updating Windows.... once I had the Surface Pro updated to Windows 8.1, voila, the option to project to a wireless display was there! Excited, I was able to finally wirelessly mirror my tablet (via Miracast) to my 60&#34; LCD tv. Sitting on my armchair, at about a distance of 10 feet from the tv, I began streaming a tv show from Hulu Plus. At first it worked, but after a few minutes, the stream would cut in and out. It quickly became unwatchable due to the frequent disruption in connection.I thought maybe this was due to the distance between the tablet and the PTV3000 (which was only ~10 feet), so then I put the tablet right next to the PTV3000... no improvement. The video stream was still disconnecting every few minutes. I double-checked that I had the latest drivers for both the Surface Pro and the PTV3000 (which I did), and I even tried rolling back to an older driver/firmware version for the PTV3000. After several hours of trying to get a steady video/audio connection, I eventually gave up and returned the device.I really wanted this to work... it's amazing being untethered and walking around with your tablet and mirroring the display and touch gestures. So I envy those Kindle Fire owners who have had no issue with this device, but I just couldn't get it to function properly with my Windows Surface Pro tablet. I'm a fairly tech-savvy person, but it shouldn't be this difficult to get it to work... I don't know if it's the fault of Microsoft or Netgear (or both), but it seems your mileage my vary with this product.",0.0

We've taken it to the beach, where I took various photos in and under the waves.  No problems at all with leaking.  The procedure to prevent leaks is easy but you do have to pay attention to the tiniest hair or grain of sand.  Very easy to hit the on-off button or the movie record button instead of the shutter button, but I've already gotten better at that.  GPS is reliable so far, but does use battery up fairly quickly. Our normal beach time is about 3 hours, and if I leave the GPS on, the battery is down to 1 bar by the end of the trip.  Turn the GPS off and I am down to 2 bars.  Picture quality is decent to good, focusing is a little challenging but okay in most situations.  No regrets so far.  Menu is reasonably intuitive.  The anti-leak procedure warnings come up every time you turn the camera on, which is annoying.  I've tried to find a way to turn it off but so far, no luck.I bought theChums Waterproof Camera Floatand am very happy with it.

It worked great for these uses although you typically have to do a bit of photoshopping to adjust the color and dynamics for how water depth changes the color of things underwater.  No getting around that...  I never got down to 40 feet, but probably wandered down past 15 feet chasing some critters so I could photo them.  Worked fine, with no leakage plus a simple cleanup afterwards as per instructions.I also discovered it's an excellent all purpose point and shoot camera with a number of very nice features.  The biggest surprise was it's ability to take excellent closeup dental macro photos, rivaling that of my dedicated DSLR Macro rig costing well over $1500.  I bought a second TS4 to just have at the clinic for that purpose.I've taken some nice timelapse sunset shots, quite a few stitched together pano shots, as well as photos of all sorts (landscape, sunsets, HDR, portrait, flowers, family).  I had to google for software to make animated gif picture files of sunsets -- didn't come with the camera...  It's optical zoom is modest at 4x, but that's an expected compromise of a rugged submersible camera.  Anything higher requires a tripod or firm hand to get jiggle free photos, even with the image stabilization it has.  Being a relatively light camera (compared to DSLRs), it works fine with light wieght tripods, particularly that which have velcro straps to attach to things (posts, trees, railings).It did take some retraining on holding a camera to keep my dufus left finger out of the lens that is in the upper left corner as you hold the camera.  Mine came with a rubber protective cover, that probably saves on scratches and dings.  It's seems a very rugged camera.Bought an extra battery and vehicle charger for trips.  Battery life seems excellent -- ran out after a full hour of snorkeling with the camera on the whole time, taking a huge number of shots plus some video underwater.",1.0

It comes with a few velcro walls that you can move around to fit your different equipment, camera, lenses, etc.  Pockets on the sides seem decent for extra memory cards, or memory card readers.  I like that the bag zips closed, and then locks closed with the clips you can see on the outside, so it seals up pretty well, I saw other people complaining that other brand name bags still allowed dust and dirt inside, this one shouldn't have that problem.  Bag is a nice size overall, not too big, not too small.  It does have a pocket built in for a tablet, but it won't hold anything over a 7&#34; tablet, and if you have a case on your tablet it will be a tight fit.  I'm pretty impressed with Amazon's line of basics products.",1.0

However, the $24.99 that this is going for right now is still a great price.  Especially since this is so well built.  This is called a ""gadget"" bag, but it's really a DSLR camera bag.  This is great for your camera, your lenses, various batteries, a small tablet (like a Kindle) and probably a bunch of other stuff, but I ran out of camera things.  If you take the cushions out and leave it somewhere, you'll find that an 11 lb cat will fit in it, though he can't lay down.  But he will try.Once you chase the cat out, if you don't want to put in a DLSR, you can fit a Kindle Paperwhite with a case, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 in a Quorky case, an Elph camera with a case, a Limeade Blaset 18000 mah with case, an EasyAcc 12000mah power bank (without a case, though I'm sure if it's not too big, you can include it), various charging plugs, a screen wipe, and a small thing of lotion.  If you take the internal cushioned separators out, you can putGrumpy Cat: A Grumpy Book, a small bag of jerky, and a candy bar.  That's not even including the stuff you can put in the two side pockets and the front pocket.All silliness aside, this is really well built.  The stitching is tight, the zippers run smooth, the sides are cushioned really well, and the things that are for separating your lenses and stuff are also good cushions.  This is small enough to shove under the airplane seat in front of you, even if you're flying cattle class, yet as long as the person in front doesn't lean back, you can pull it back out again to get your stuff while the plane is flying.This is not TSA friendly, though.  If you have a lot of batteries or things with batteries in there, either take them out and put them in the plastic bins, or resign yourself to a pat down.  (There is lead in batteries, and x-rays don't go through lead.  TSA people get weird about this - FYI.)This is very nice, looks professional, and is well built.",1.0

(the dividers are good I would not use this bag for hiking but in city its great!)The multiple pockets and straps make the functionality and storage great!Cons:None I can think of by far the best bag under 75$ and its way under that.I am amazed at the quality and price of this bag and would recommend it to anyone on a budget and to most who are not.

I replaced my old Nikon 4300 with this - it's a fraction of the size and weight. My only complaint is that I've had to send it in for service due to dust interfering with the lens extension / bellows assembly. Never had that happen with the 4300, but likely a common problem with all the new tiny cameras.",1.0
2020-12-23 12:47:42,1608727662,B00CDS9HTM,AmazonBasics Large DSLR Gadget Bag (Gray interior),VERY well made; smart design...,"I own a DSLR backpack as well a DSLR sling (this one from Case Logic, which has been and remains my all-around favorite:Case Logic CPL-107GY Camera Sling for DSLR, Gray), but I also wanted a shoulder bag I could ""grab and go"" for short excursions.  When the chance to get this Amazon Basics version came up via the Vine program, I decided to get it to give it a test run.  I am really pleased with this bag overall, and I think the current price offering of $25 (as of this writing) makes it a great deal.The two side pockets are great for storing things you want to get fast access to, or for dropping in your lens cap.  They both can be zipped shut with top zippers that can be quickly utilized.  The top cover not only buckles securely at the front, but also grabs the top of the bag with Velcro.  It acts as a protective overlay across the top of the bag that provides extra protection against water damage from rain, etc.The front pocket has a zipper mesh lining, which is on the inside of the front of this pocket.  I use it to store extra SD cards within a case I have for them.  It also has a place to insert a couple of pens, and an open pocket against the back side of this pocket. The top of the case zips shut, and has yet another mesh pocket underneath.  This top cover is also thickly padded, as is the bottom and the sides of the bag.There are four adjustable dividers within the main compartment of the bag, which allows for flexibility of how you configure the interior.  Keep in mind that even though this bag is touted as a ""large,"" if you own a full-size DSLR your configuration choices will be limited, depending on which lens you have attached (if any).  Since I want this bag to be a ""grab-and-go"", I want keep my primary lens attached, which is a Canon EF24-105mm IS lens on a Canon 6D body.  I found my choices are very limited in how to position the camera within the bag due to its size (see my uploaded photos for reference).The slot the bag has to carry your iPad Mini, Nexus 7, or Kindle Fire is exactly that....a slot.  I am able to fit in my Kindle Fire 8.9"" HD, but just barely, which you can also see in the photos I uploaded.  It slightly sticks up at the top, but it's better than not having this capability at all, I suppose.Overall, though, I do recommend the bag consider it very high quality construction and its price. I hope the review and the photos help you in your purchasing decision, and if you have any questions please feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer.  Thanks for reading!",1.0

2020-12-23 14:06:11,1608732371,B00CDS9HTM,AmazonBasics Large DSLR Gadget Bag (Gray interior),"Great bag, decent size, terrible strap","I've been using this bag for a few months now, and use it to carry my Canon Powershot SX50 camera (and the SX40 before that.) It's well made, and the detachable velcro compartment separators work great. I also carry a tablet, several spare batteries, a table-top tripod, and a 'travel' tripod, as well as a remote shutter release and extension cable. It fits all of this stuff easily, and I'm also able to stuff a light jacket in as well, so I'm covered if it gets cool out.What I don't like about this bag is the shoulder strap and the tripod straps. The tripod straps are simply too small, even for my travel tripod, which requires me to place 2 of the 3 legs into the straps, and then I have to use an additional velcro strap that I added to one of the tripod's legs in order to keep the 3rd leg secured. The pad on the shoulder strap is curved, which at first seemed like a good idea, however after a couple of months of usage, it's become apparent that it was actually a bad idea. The reason I say it was a bad idea is because it is causing the strap to 'bunch up' within the pad, right where the curve is, which is now causing the strap to put more pressure on a smaller section of my shoulder as opposed to distributing the weight evenly across the pad. On top of that, the nylon clips on the strap squeak like nobody's business (my wife has actually taken to calling me ""Squeaky"" because of the noise it makes.) In any case, I ordered a new strap that has a straight pad on it and metal clips, so I'm hoping that will alleviate both the squeaking and the way the strap bunches up within the pad. If it weren't for the shoulder strap and the way-too-short tripod straps, this bag could have easily earned a 5 star rating from me, but I had to knock a star off because of those issues.Pros - Decently sized bag, with good padding and internal velcro compartment dividers that can be rearranged to suit the equipment you're carrying. A padded pocket inside, that is useful for carrying a small tablet. Lots of pockets and compartments to hold your additional memory cards, cables and other accessories.Cons - Curve in the shoulder strap's pad causes the strap to 'bunch up' within the pad after some usage. The nylon clips used to attach the strap to the bag are very noisy, and the squeak has not gotten any better after several months of use (in fact, it gets worse if you add more weight to the bag.) Straps for tripod are way too short, and are actually better suited to a monopod.Edit on May 3, 2014 - I purchased a new strap to replace the one that came with this bag. The strap I purchased isClip On Travel Strap, which has metal clips (so there is no longer any squeaking), and the shoulder pad is sewn into the strap, so it doesn't slide around nor does it bunch up anywhere, since it doesn't have a bend in it. I also purchased some velcro strapsVelcro Velstrap Cinch Straps, 18 x 1 Inches, Black, 2 Pack (90107)that I worked into the tripod strap clips, and now use those to secure my tripod. These work much better than the tripod straps that are already on the bag, if you're using a full size tripod that won't fit into the existing straps.",1.0

2020-12-23 14:49:50,1608734990,B00CDS9HTM,AmazonBasics Large DSLR Gadget Bag (Gray interior),Affordable Great Protection for your Gadgets,"The Amazon Gadget Bag is well constructed and fairly sturdy, and should hold up for quite a while.  The design is different than several other bags I have seen and/or used. When you unbuckle to open the top flap there is Velcro that also holds it in place, connected to a zippered cover over the main interior. This can be a little annoying as it takes more time getting to your gadgets. But it is a good safety feature in the event that your buckles somehow come out when the bag is slung over your shoulder, i.e., nothing will fall out. The bag is quite well padded to provide protection if dropped. The shoulder strap is pretty well padded providing more than adequate comfort for longer treks and the carry handle padding is also pretty good.The interior will hold a DSLR body with 1 to 3 small to medium lenses, depending upon the size of the lenses and hoods you wish to take. In other words, it will not hold a DSLR body and a 70-200 lens. For instance, it will hold a Nikon D7000 with MB-11 Battery Pack attached (standing), along with a Tamron 24-70mm f/2.8 lens with hood attached, and a Nikon Nikkor 12-24mm f/4 with its hood unattached in a separate slot. The bag width is such that the camera body fits quite snug.On the inside of the interior lid is a zippered mesh pocket which is good for extra memory cards, cleaning cloths and other smaller thin items. The outside front zippered pocket, which is covered by the flap when closed, has another zippered mesh pocket inside, an open space and another un-zippered pouch, along with two holders for lens pens and the like. This outside pocket will easily hold a Kindle Fire HD 7"" with the BUILT Slim Cover attached. There are zippered exterior pockets on either side, which provide quick access for spare batteries, spare lens caps, even an iPhone or other smart phone device. There are two straps at the bottom front allowing you to attach a tripod, though I have not used this feature.This large Amazon Gadget Bag is quite useful for packing a small amount of select gear and various bits and bobs to take with you and will provide very good protection for your gadgets.",1.0
2020-12-23 15:10:40,1608736240,B00904JILO,NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter with Miracast (PTV3000) Certified for use with Kindle Fire HDX,Fairly Good Miracast Adapter for Windows 8.1 / Microsoft Surface Tables,"Works pretty well with the Microsoft Surface Pro, Surface Pro 2, and Surface 2.  I own a Surface Pro 2 and use it with this product regularly, but I have also had opportunities to test it with the original Surface Pro (with Windows 8.1 update) and Surface 2.  I have used it to Miracast several movies to my TV and once it's connected it works great.Before you spend any time at all trying to get this thing to work, download and install the latest firmware from the Netgear website.  Also, run windows update or get the latest updates for whatever OS you are using.  For the Microsoft surface line of tablets you'll need Windows 8.1 and the updates (drivers and firmware updates) up to early November 2013 for Miracast support to be functional.The streaming has very little lag and the video/audio are in sync on the remote TV.  Local audio gets disabled so you won't hear an echo effect due to any delay.  The lag is probably around 0.3 seconds max, but it's hard to measure even when attempting to watch the local and remote screen at the same time.  For very fast paced games that require real time reactions it may be too much lag, but for anything else it is basically a non-issue.Minor issues...- The device has to be unplugged and restarted more often than I would like.  On the TV screen it will show the ""waiting for connection"" message, but when you attempt to connect it's as if it's not listening.  My Surface Pro 2 will either not see it or say that it couldn't connect.  If I unplug the PTV3000 and plug it back in everything will work fine.  However, I have to do this about every third or forth time I try to connect to it.  Hopefully a future firmware update will make it more reliable.- [See edit/update below] The edges of the screen are slightly cut off.  Maybe about 20 or 30 pixels on all four sides of the cast/projected image are cut off on the remote screen.  It doesn't really matter for watching movies or most other things, but if you are on the desktop you'll notice that about half the Start button, clock, etc. are cut off.  The device I'm using has 1080p native resolution and so does the TV so there is no reason to scale or cut off the image.  Maybe this will be fixed in a future update.- Occasionally, the video will transmit to the TV, but not the audio.  Disconnecting and reconnecting fixes the issue.  It's not a big deal at all as long as the adapter accepts the connection without needing to be restarted (see first issue).- If you let the tablet/laptop/whatever go to sleep or automatically turn off it's screen due to inactivity you usually have to reconnect.  This happens to me sometimes when I pause a movie and walk away too long.  Again, it's not a big deal at all as long as the adapter accepts the connection without needing to be restarted (see first issue).Overall, even thought this device is a bit flakey about accepting connections, it's easily fixed with a quick restart and it works very well once a connection has been made.  For me, it's a very useful device even with the minor flaws that it currently has.*** Update 11/24/2013 ***Netgear has released a new firmware update (v2.4.26) that addresses the issue with screen edges being slightly cut off.  This has resolved that issue for me and the remote screen now matches the local screen perfectly.  The firmware update also seems to have helped with the issue of having to restart the device on a fairly frequent basis.  It's a lot more reliable now and I have used it several times over the past several days without having to restart anything.  If the device had been this way out of the box I would have given it 5 stars.  However, for me, I had to deal with these issues for a while after purchase so it was not a perfect customer experience.  People purchasing it now will get a great experience as long as they have the latest firmware installed before they try to use it.",1.0

Not according to Kindle Specialists!,"This device does not work with the Kindle Fire HDX.  Period.  The Kindle specialists will bounce you around for a few hours and then either tell you directly it doesn't work because it is defective, refer you to Netgear for  their expert opinion or flat out tell you that only a Samsung 2013 Smart television or PS3 (or PS4 soon) will allow you to mirror your HDX device.I went through multiple Netgear units and was told every excuse under the sun until someone finally had the integrity to tell me it just isn't designed to work with the HDX.  I can't explain why some folks are able to use it but this technology is not designed well and the customer service from Netgear is lousy based on my experiences.Honestly, save the emotional and financial root canal.  I'm a loyal Kindle consumer and think the HDX is great but if you want to mirror a kindle device, buy a refurbished HD 7 or 8.9&#34; and use the micro-HDMI port.  It is tested technology that works.

I did not have any leaking issues that these cameras are known for even after submerging both in the ocean and during the cleaning process.However, if I had to pick something to caution about this product, here are a couple of items.First, the GPS is slow to update and the height is off quite a bit.  As I was standing on the shore line of the Atlantic, it told me I was 15ft above sea level.  Then the number started varying between 15 and 25 feet.  It also took a few pictures for the location information to update on the camera, and the time to update the information varied.Second, it will randomly caution about making sure the door is closed and locked before using the camera.  Doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but with a camera known for being exceptionally fast to pull up and take a picture (think baby's first step type of moments), you then have to Ok a dialog on the camera telling you to make sure the door is locked before taking pictures.However, overall, I am more than pleased with this purchase and would not trade it for anything.",1.0

I tried several times with the same result, but it appears that the device already had the latest firmware on it.PROS:-The unit allowed for screen mirroring on both devices (on the Galaxy Note 2 you use ""AllShare Cast"" for the application; on the Nexus 7 you use the native wireless display function in Android 4.3). Video quality was respectable but not exceptional.CONS:-When changing screens, playing videos, etc. the unit sometimes has lag and/or distortion/pixelation in the image.  The degree ranges from none at all to severe.-When I disconnect the Nexus 7 from the adapter, and then later try to re-connect, it is usually necessary for me to unplug the adapter from AC and re-apply the AC before I can connect again.  If I do not go through this step, the device will show as paired but not as available for connection. This is VERY annoying.I have not yet decided whether I will keep this unit or return it.  I want to perform some additional testing.",0.0

I were expecting something larger and still would that it were.Nevertheless, I took it out nearly as soon as I had it unpacked to see if it and I would get along.A really nice thing about it is the thoughtful design of the compartments which are created by rigid leaves which have velcro strip on either end so that one can adjust the size of a compartment simply by tearing the leaf away from its perch and repositioning it in the desired location thus the compartment size is infinitely adjustable dependent only by the dimensions of the bag.I also like the included strap which is similarly adjustable.  That is to say that it is on a looped buckle that allows one to pull it in to about the size of a large hand strap or pull it out to the length of a shoulder strap.  Very nice.The bag is also heavily padded which means that one's expensive and delicate gear is protected from bumps and drops, yet the bag remains remarkably light in weight.What I do not like about the design is the use of large, bulky plastic snap latches for securing the lid.  They feel cheap and are a bit of a hassle to use.  Also the handle design is over the top.  It makes a bit of sense after one thinks about it but in my opinion it is needlessly fussy.",1.0

2020-12-24 10:38:29,1608806309,B00CDS9HTM,AmazonBasics Large DSLR Gadget Bag (Gray interior),A worthwhile purchase for budding photographers!,"Even if you're not a new photographer, if you've got two lenses and a flash, you're going to want to be able to carry it all safely and comfortably for cheap!This thing feels pretty well made; the padding is sufficiently thick, and the materials seem sturdy. Indeed, this bag has served me well for the past few months with only cosmetic damage. It can handle more stuff than I even have! But, I'm pretty barebones: my camera, my two lenses, a speedlight, an extra battery + charger, a tripod, and my bible. It can fit a full-sized iPad in the iPad mini sleeve if you want, but it'll be a tight fit.Best of all, it's comfortable. The strap placement is good and the padded shoulder protector makes this comfortable to wear, even for long periods of time (spent a whole day with it on the pier).The drawback is that it's kind of bulky, especially if you only have packed in as much as I do. It makes it difficult to get through doors (you kind of forget it's there, so you just bump into the frame), and it gets awkward in crowds.My one gripe is the plastic strap loops. They feel cheap and they sound cheap. Actually, they sound annoying. Because they're plastic, when the strap hook and the bag loops squeak whenever you move, creating a really grating, almost nails-on-a-chalkboard sound. I dampen this sound by pressing my thumb on the offending loop, but this is really annoying. I really wish the loops and hook were made from metal. I'm going to apply some silicone oil to see if that helps.At any rate, though, this is a great, cheap bag to carry your photo gear!",1.0

SO i came across this, it had great reviews, and looked very nice.Now after using it for a couple of days, it feels very high quality, i use a messenger back for carrying all of my stuff so the fact that it can't really carry much more doesn't bother me. From the photos, you should already know that, though. So, i don't understand why people would give this a bad review for that fact. It's a &#34;wallet-case&#34; not a full blown case.Now, my only concern is the inside material, and fitting the Type Cover 2 in with my Surface 2. It fits my Surface 2 PERFECT, but with my Type Cover , it gets super snug (no pun intended, lol). I thought it would be fine, so after using it about two times with the Type Cover connected, i felt the inside and the material is starting to loosen up.. So, i am definitely not putting my Surface in the wallet with the keyboard attached anymore. Kind of a bummer, but the fact that i carry most of my stuff around with a messenger bag doesn't make it a deal breaker for me, but it might for other people who use a Type Cover (i'm not sure how the Touch Cover would fit).I don't think it is the size of both of them together, i think it is the material on the back of the Type Cover 2, it feels almost like felt/microfiber clothe, so it rubs against the inside of the Snugg case.Overall, i am very pleased with this, even with the minor con i do recommend this.",1.0

Sometimes every few minutes (when in photo mode), sometimes every few seconds.  The 'flashing' also resets the camera to ready to shoot mode, and happens almost instantly any time a menu is entered, meaning I can't even get in to do a reset of the camera to see if that helps.  My best guess, and this is a guess, is that one of the buttons is being automatically pushed and causes the camera to drop everything and go back to the main screen.I've searched for the possibility of doing a hard reset, but haven't found anything so far.Camera has not been dropped, frozen or used in water (which is too bad, because kayaking was the long term plan for it).Edit - 05/16/13I eventually got the camera stable enough to dig and find the reset option.  This did nothing.  Still thinking it might be a button, I disassembled the entire thing (FYI two of the front screws are fake and never come out).  I didn't see any notable damage to the PCBs, ribbon cables or internal connectors.  I eventually noticed that the video out connector had some corrosion.  Scrubbed that out with a stiff brush and some pure alcohol (not the common 30% water variety), and voila, camera works like normal.  I went back with a tiny scalpel and made sure to clean up the pins well.  Camera has worked fine since.  I'm thinking that a drop of water got into the connector port causing the corrosion.  The camera then saw some signal between pins and kept switching over to external video mode - which correlates with the 16:9 or 4:3 messages I would see flashed on the screen.I'm confident enough that this was the complete problem and that it is fully fixed that that I gave it back to my girlfriend (it was hers) and bought a second one for myself.I'll give it four stars now, because I suspect that it could have been designed to not have voltage on those pins when they are not in use, which is what made it susceptible to the corrosion, but also, I believe I did get water on the connector, which is completely my fault.  Also, if video out were a manual setting, the corrosion would still exist, but since I never used video out, it never would have caused a functional issue with the camera.",1.0

I'm klutzy, I drop cameras. Plus I wanted to get something more modern with a GPS in it, and waterproof as a little bonus.After orienting myself to the camera for a couple weeks it was off to Cuba where I took about 1300 photos. The short review is that I had to toss out maybe 10 photos for being out of focus, but this was mostly because I took a lot of pictures out the bus window and didn't always remember to have 'through glass' mode turned on. If I have one complaint, and it's a common one for pocket cameras, is that in low light conditions it doesn't always choose the right mode or focus on the right thing. Most of the stuff I want to take pictures of is outdoors so I don't have a need to take a lot of indoor pictures, in low light, in large open areas.Most common used modes:Through glass - About a third of my pictures were taken through the bus window. If you don't hold the camera close enough to the glass you tend to get reflections, but beyond that it's difficult to tell the pictures were taken while moving. Focus and color are brilliant.Panorama - I never got sick of this novelty. It's more fun than you think.Underwater - No leakage problems. I followed the instructions, unlike some folks on other reviews of this camera. You soak it for 10 minutes or LESS. And let it dry upright. I was in the water for about an hour and had no problems whatsoever. READ THAT MANUAL!Intelligent Auto - Impressive. The auto scene selection on this model is better than the last one I had. Much, much better. It focuses faster. It flashes when it's supposed to flash. It chooses macro mode when it should. This is as close to an idiot-proof camera as I have ever seen.What about battery life? I packed three batteries and kept them charged every day. For a nine day trip, I only used a second battery one time. This may sound like bad battery life but note that I had the LCD on all the time, and GPS was never turned off. Plus I was using an Eye-Fi card which has a wifi antenna built into it. Consider that throughout the day, taking an average of 140 pictures a day, that I was constantly turning it on and off, too. I thought this was pretty good battery life considering all the strain I was putting on it. I barely get a day out of a full charge on my phone, and I don't even use it! :)Overall I'm thrilled with this camera. It's a camera a traveler can toss in a backpack and not worry about being rough with it. You point it at stuff, press the button, and it takes great pictures. No muss, no fuss, though there are plenty of settings and modes you can muss with if you want. For my purposes, for capturing life as it happens without worry, I'm glad I chose this camera.I uploaded some pictures to this review.

Well, fear no more, Amazonbasics has you covered!This is an excellent gadget bag, and especially affordable too (at least at the time of this writing).  Besides being affordable, it has a lot of other great attributes.  First off, the bag's exterior is made of that nice nylon water repellent (NOT NECESSARILY WATERPROOF!) fabric, and it has a nice structured shape to it.  There's the option of a handle on top, or a shoulder strap for carrying.  The padded portion on the strap is adjustable (you can move it's position around) or you can even remove it if you don't like it.  The bag also features many pockets (6 full pockets counting the inner ones with zipper closures, and two inner sleeves along with some pencil/pen holders), and very nice sturdy inner padding.  The main compartment features many sub-compartments that are actually attached by velcro to the fuzzy inner walls.  That means you can remove them completely or rearrange the compartments to better suit your needs!  This was quite an innovative idea and greatly appreciated.  The main compartment also has one of the  sleeves (mentioned earlier) in it, which is made to hold an ipad or kindle or some other type of pad device.  That's quite nifty too.While this bag is doubtless great for cameras, because the inner compartment pockets are removable, this can technically be an ""anything"" bag.  I'm personally going to use it to carry all my electronic junk (ipad, 3DS, phone charger, etc.) when I go on vacations.  This should help me keep it all together but still more accessible than being stuck in a giant duffle bag.  Plus, all the heavy padding makes my items much better protected than your average bag.  There's even rubber bumpers on the bottom to pad it from shock whenever you set it on the floor!Now, I'm going to list all the relevant measurements I can think of to try to help out other customers.  Ok, so here goes:  the outer dimensions- 9 inches tall, 7 inches wide (without anything in it, it might get wider if you stuff it full), and 13 inches long.  The two small pockets on the side are 6in. high by 5 in. wide (depth would vary on how full you stuff it).  The front pocket is 11in. wide by 6.5in. tall.  The interior dimensions of the main inner pocket (not counting all the removable compartments) are 10in. long by 5in. wide, and 6.5in. high.  Lastly, the shoulder strap is 56.5in. when fully extended, and 35.5in. when shortened as much as you can get it (without removing the shoulder pad).  You could probably get it even shorter if you took the shoulder pad off, but I don't know why anyone would need it that short.  Anyway, that's all I can think of, hope it helps!",1.0

I had this camera for about 15 minutes before I realized I was probably going to return it, though I continued to try it in different scenarios for two days in the hopes it might magically improve and be ""the one.""Pros:~ Good color variety~ Menu features are easy to navigate, with many optionsCons:~ If flash is not used/subject does not hold *perfectly* still, photos are blurry (even in a well-lit living room). This essentially means that, if you want to take photos during a group event/game night, you're going to be flashing everyone in the face or you'll have poor, blurry photos.~ Panorama feature is TERRIBLE. I took about 40 panoramic shots, both in- and outdoors. 37 of them had large gray sections in the final project, taking up between 25 and 50% of the picture. Additionally, all of the ones that included people distorted the features of the people.~ Here are a few of the pictures I took in the first night, examples of the above cons: imgur.com/a/ic4L7",0.0

This product doesn't work with any of them.  I guess I should've done a little more research before I got this product.  I'm not sure why the list of products that are supported aren't listed here on the Amazon page but you can see a list of the products on Netgears site.  There are a very limited number of products that this will work with.  I was very disappointed that neither of my newer laptops or my iPad would work with this.My mom's smartphone was one of the supported devices so I did take her phone for a while to give the product a try.  It took a bit of work to get it to work but I finally got it.  It was neat but wasn't what I needed it for.Maybe someday I'll have a device that will work with this product but for now the product is useless to me.

I've tried everything and I am now going to buy a Canon like my last one and just keep this in my pocket for the unexpected day to day photos outside.I also don't like the very small and fragile USB connection for charging the battery. The same type of connector was used in my last camera and it did not last long, but I was able to remove the batteries for recharging. I don't know yet if there is an external battery charger when this connector fails. To be on the safe side, I'm very careful when connecting the cable in hopes it will last a little longer before I have to buy another camera when I can no longer charge it.",0.0

It was exactly what I was looking for and carries a decent price tag.The one concern is that it is listed as a large gadget bag.  I don't know that I would classify it as large as it is big enough to carry a single dslr with a couple of lenses and a hand full of filters and gadgets. It is actually just the standard base camera kit bag.  So it has enough room to do a day trip, but don't look to deeply into the &#34;Large&#34; in the description.I have actually made this into my birding grab bag and field library.
