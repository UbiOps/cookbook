# Cookbook

Welcome to the UbiOps cookbook!

Here you can find a collection of examples of working with UbiOps. Use it to find inspiration or to discover new ways of
working with our software. The examples range from full on use case examples to more integrational and practical
examples. 
Eventhough the examples require compute power and resources, a free UbiOps account offers enough to run them. To test out
the cookbook examples you will not need a paid UbiOps account and you will not be billed for the resources you use when 
testing the examples. *


## Requirements
To be able to use the UbiOps cookbook you need three things:
- You need to have the UbiOps client library installed. This can be done via pip install or via Setuptools. For more 
information see [the GitHub page](https://github.com/UbiOps/client-library-python).
- You need to be able to run Jupyter Notebook.
- You need to have a UbiOps account. You can create a free account [here](https://app.ubiops.com/sign-up).


## How does it work?
Every *recipe* contains a standalone example with all the material you need to test it out. They are all centered around 
a jupyter notebook that contains both fully functioning code to create the examples in your own UbiOps environment, and 
explanations on how it's all done. 


## The current recipes
- [Creating a training and production pipeline with Scikit Learn in UbiOps](scikit-deployment/README.md)
- [Triggering a deployment/pipeline request from Google Cloud Functions](google-cloud-functions-triggered-request/README.md)
- [Using blobs as temporary storage](blobs-temporary-storage/README.md)
- [Azure Data Factory and UbiOps pipeline interaction tutorial](azure-data-factory/README.md)
- [Pipeline that matches, orders and visualises a list of Pokemon
](pokemonpipeline/Readme.md)
- [Scheduled pipeline that classifies Amazon reviews](amazon-review-pipeline/README.md)

*It might be that you will need to make some space in your existing environment to run the examples though to stay 
within the limits.
